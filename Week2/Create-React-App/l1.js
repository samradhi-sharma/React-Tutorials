// A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an "origin" server
// to end users around the globe by caching content nearby each user's point of
// internet access. 

// Drawbacks of using CDNs
// ● An essential prerequisite is an internet connection.
// ● If there is a server issue, packages might not load.


// How to overcome the drawbacks?
// We can overcome drawbacks by installing packages locally and using
// webpack which helps in file management and linking.
