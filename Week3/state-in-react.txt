/**State in react/ 
. When we were creating movie app we were hard coding all the movies, for now its okay
because there are less number of movies so there where state came into picture.
. If you want to understand that what is state in simple terms ... it is more like a contaiber that actuall stores all the real time data for any variable, we can also say dynamic data it can store.
. So in react we can use state to store dynamic data.
. is built in object 
. we should know that state is asynchronous like setState method works in that way.
that means after calling setState method, the this.state variable is not immediately changed.
